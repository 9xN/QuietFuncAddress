# QuietFuncAddress

QuietFuncAddress is a simple project that demonstrates how to retrieve the address of a Windows API function using assembly language within a C program. This project provides a minimalistic example of integrating assembly code into a C program to obtain the address of a specified function dynamically.

### Usage

1. **Compilation**:
   - Assemble the `get_function_address.asm` file using NASM to generate `get_function_address.obj`.
   - Compile the `main.c` file along with `get_function_address.obj` using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

   Example commands:
   ```bash
   nasm -f win64 get_function_address.asm -o get_function_address.obj
   gcc -o main main.c get_function_address.obj
   ```

2. **Execution**:
   - Run the compiled executable (`main.exe` on Windows) to retrieve the address of the specified function.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   main.exe
   ```

### Functionality

The C program (`main.c`) includes an external assembly function declaration `GetFunctionAddress`, which is implemented in `get_function_address.asm`. This assembly function is responsible for dynamically locating the address of a specified function within the loaded modules.

In the `main` function of `main.c`, the `GetFunctionAddress` function is called with the name of the target function as an argument. If the function address is successfully retrieved, it is printed to the console along with additional information.

### Files

- `get_function_address.asm`: Assembly file containing the implementation of the `GetFunctionAddress` function.
- `main.c`: C source code that calls the `GetFunctionAddress` function to obtain the address of a specified function.
- `get_function_address.obj`: Object file generated by assembling `get_function_address.asm`.

### Dependencies

- NASM: The Netwide Assembler is used to assemble the assembly code (`get_function_address.asm`).
- C Compiler: A C compiler (e.g., GCC) is required to compile the C source code (`main.c`) along with the object file (`get_function_address.obj`).

### Note

This project serves as a simple demonstration and may require modifications for specific use cases or different environments.
